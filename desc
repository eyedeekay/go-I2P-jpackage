Embeddedable, Updatable I2P Jpackage for Go and Portables
=========================================================

This is an experimental piece of software for running an I2P Router without
any dependencies in a portable manner on Windows and Linux. It turns any Go
application into a self-contained installer of the Java I2P router, and makes
the Go application capable of managing the router unpacked by that installer.

It is an experiment and not ready for general use.
